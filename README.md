## Pros 
### 1.	Smart AI Integration
 - With Google GenAI under the hood, users don't just compile codeâ€”they can ask for code explanations also. This transforms the compiler into a virtual programming assistant.

### 2. AI Code Generator
- With Google GenAI under the hood, users can also generate code with the help of AI and used that code as per thier convenience.

### 3. User-Friendly & Aesthetic UI
-  Thanks to Tailwind CSS and a dark-themed, glowing interface, users enjoy a visually polished and developer-friendly environment, enhancing productivity and reducing eye strain.

### 4. Built for the Cloud
- The project is lightweight and browser-accessible, requiring no installationsâ€”ideal for learning, quick testing, and collaboration.

## Cons
### 1.	Security Considerations
- Running user code, even with safeguards, poses security risks. Proper sandboxing or containerization (e.g., Docker) would be essential for production-level deployment.

### 2.	Execution Speed and API Latency
- AI requests via Google GenAI can be slower depending on internet speed and API response time, especially during heavy usage or with complex queries.

### 3.	Limited Runtime Support (for Now)
- The current version may only support a few languages or limited functionality. Full multi-language support and real-time execution environments are in progress.

### 4. Data Inaccuracy
- Sometimes, data may be inaccurate due to intervention of AI. Check it further before using it somewhere else.

## Future Scope
### 1.	AI-Powered Debugging & Suggestions
- Evolve beyond simple code explanations. Integrate GenAI to identify bugs, suggest improvements, and even refactor code intelligently.

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration
- Enable live coding sessions and pair programming featuresâ€”ideal for teams, classrooms, or remote interviews.

### 3. User Profiles & Code Saving
- Implement authentication so users can save and manage code snippets, revisit past sessions, and track their learning progress.

### 4.	Secure Code Execution Environment
- Add Docker-based or serverless sandboxing to securely compile and run code without riskâ€”ready for production or public use.
